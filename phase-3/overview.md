# Phase 3: Security & Advanced Features (4 Weeks)  
**Objective**: Secure APIs and implement advanced features like GraphQL.  

## Learning Objectives  
- Implement JWT and OAuth2 authentication.  
- Design role-based access control (RBAC).  
- Build GraphQL APIs with Apollo Server.  

## Key Topics  
- **Passport.js**: Local and OAuth2 strategies.  
- **RBAC**: Admin/Editor/User role enforcement.  
- **GraphQL**: Queries, mutations, resolvers.  

## Projects  
1. **CMS with RBAC**  
   - Admin dashboard for content management.  
   - Role-based access to endpoints.  
2. **GraphQL API**  
   - Apollo Server integration.  
   - Fetch and mutate data with GraphQL.  

## Tools & Technologies  
- Passport.js  
- Apollo Server  
- Swagger (API documentation)  

## Expected Outcomes  
- Secure APIs with authentication and RBAC.  
- Build a functional GraphQL API.
