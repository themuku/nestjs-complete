- **SQLite**: Lightweight database for prototyping.  

## Projects  
1. **Blog with Prisma**  
   - Users, posts, and comments with PostgreSQL.  
   - Advanced queries (filtering, sorting).  
2. **Product Catalog**  
   - MongoDB Atlas integration for product data.  
   - CRUD operations with Mongoose.  

## Tools & Technologies
